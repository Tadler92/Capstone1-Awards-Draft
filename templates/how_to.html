        Now that you've created your account, you can either <a href="/groups">join a group</a> or <a href="/groups/add">create your own group</a>! 
      </p>

      <p>
        It is only once you are part of a group that you can draft films to recieve points an compete with others.  Each group can have a maximum of 8 people in them; this is mostly due to the fact that there are more movies that come out in a given year than there are movies that get nominated and win awards, so past 8 members in a group, you risk a number of the members getting 0 points the entire awards season...
